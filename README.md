swan.js
=======

What is it?
-----------
Swan.js is a personal little experiment to bring an interface-like mechanism to JavaScript, which conforms in large part
with the idea of duck-typing.

Why is it called swan.js?
-------------------------
The naming is as far-fetched as taking the sometimes bad reputation given duck-typing, turning it into the story of the
ugly duckling and jumping to the end where he/she turns out to be a swan.

What are archetypes?
--------------------
Archetypes are what you would normally call an interface, but since the word interface has such tight associations associated
with it I decided to use a different name. An archetype differs from an interface in that an object itself is not an explicit
implementation of an interface, but rather an implicit match based on what functions, properties and variables are assigned to
it. As such, an interface would be a static property of an object, while an archetype is something that could change over time
when the object is rewritten.
